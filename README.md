They take calculated risks and make decisions under uncertainty, balancing boldness with analysis. Innovation and creativity help them develop differentiated products, services, or processes. Strong communication, networking, and adaptability let them lead teams and pivot when markets change.

**Real-life Example:** A student who starts a juice stall, experiments with new flavors, and adapts recipes based on customer feedback.

---

### 2. Role of Creativity in Entrepreneurship

Creativity is the source of new value — it enables entrepreneurs to spot unmet needs and imagine novel solutions or improved ways of delivering value. It leads to product, process, or business-model innovations that differentiate a venture from competitors. Creative problem-solving is essential during resource constraints and helps convert challenges into opportunities.

**Real-life Example:** A lemon-juice seller adds mint and ginger variants and sells bottled takeaway to stand out.

**Memory Tip:** "Create = Find new value"

---

### 3. Idea Generation Techniques

Effective idea generation uses both open and structured methods: brainstorming (free idea flow), mind mapping (visual expansion), SCAMPER (structured modification), and SWOT (feasibility check). Combining techniques yields more usable and tested ideas ready for pilot testing.

**Real-life Example:** A tiffin service creator brainstorms menu ideas, maps target customers, uses SCAMPER to add convenience, and runs a SWOT to validate feasibility.

**Memory Tip:** "Think → Map → Modify → Test"

### 4. Components of the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem

An entrepreneurship ecosystem is the supportive environment around startups: entrepreneurs, mentors, incubators/accelerators, investors and banks, government policies and grants, universities/research, corporations, customers and supporting infrastructure. Each component supplies critical resources — knowledge, funding, market access, legal/regulatory support, and talent.
